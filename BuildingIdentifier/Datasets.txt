Building Identifier Project
**A project to create an image recognition model that can determine the construction**
**material and use of a building simply by being shown an image of it**
Authors: Timothy Boe and Taha Karimi

Datasets of interest:

1. SUN database from CSAIL: http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/SUN/hierarchy.html
	-This is the SUN2012.tar.gz file in the BuildingIdentifier folder.
	-This file contains about 5 images of each of a variety of different buildings,
	each is already annotated as to what building it is classified as.
	-Some of these images could be useful, so decided to keep the whole thing for now.
	-INTEND TO USE
	
	NOTE from site: If you find this dataset useful, please cite this paper

2. Drone-View Building Identification from: https://jacky82226.github.io/DVBI/
	-All images are located in various Dropbox links throughout the page.
	-Only some of the images under IG-City8 are useful, rest are too zoomed out/wide
	-NOT USING

3. Caltech 256 from: http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/
	-Images in the 256_ObjectCategories.tar in BuildingIdentifier folder.
	-Only want to use the skyscraper images from this.
	-NOT USING

4. CityScapes Dataset from: https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/dataset-overview/
	-Upon approval and inspection of dataset, I don't believe it is useful at all.
	-NOT USING

	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

5. Open Images Dataset V6 from: https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/visualizer/index.html?set=train&type=segmentation&r=false&c=%2Fm%2F079cl
	-Has infrastructure, bank, office, commercial, theater, garden building,
	general building, coffee house, work house, outhouse, warehouse, field house,
	pent house apartment, manor house, house, lighthouse, farmhouse, 
	opera house, boat house, slaughter house, court house, historic house,
	police station, pumping station, fire station, train station.
	-Cannot get full dataset (which is more useful) right now as the only way to 
	get it is having Google Cloud and using Google Storage Transfer. 
	-What I can get and will get is the dataset used for bounding boxes (train/val/tst)
		-will also need to download the labels for that alongside the rest.
	-NOT USING - the images are not categorized, I would have to search for buildings
			in a folder of 200,000 imgs where majority aren't buildings.

6. Pascal VOC Datasets from: http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2011/index.html#devkit
	-Has many years worth of datasets, need to see if any images within it
	could be useful to us (basically does it have any building images)
	-Downloaded two years' images and annotations, need to use code to check
	if annotations have any thing related to buildings/stations/houses/etc.

7. Places1 and Places2 Datasets, from http://places.csail.mit.edu/user/ and http://places2.csail.mit.edu/:
	-Dataset that contains a large (millions) of images on over 200 categories of
	places that people visit, include many different types of buildings.
	-Also has other places so that if a weird building is found by the camera,
	it will be more likely to know what it is
	-USING AS PRIMARY SOURCE

Other Sites:

1. Pixabay - can search any topic to get images for it.

2. Flickr - I believe the same as above.

3. ImageNet - specific searches

4. Picsearch - same

5. Google Images and Street View - Should be useful?

6. Mendeley Datasets: https://data.mendeley.com/research-data/?type=IMAGE&type=SOFTWARE_CODE&search=dataset%20of%20building%20images&page=2
	-has many datasets/articles/variety of other stuff, it does have some articles on
	ML for building recognition, although accessing that information usually requires
	access to the article, and also many of them are aerial images or drone related,
	which is not useful for us as of now.

Notes:

-look into something called 'Clutter' which is used to see if a classifier is
robust enough to handle images not containing an object category.
-in addition to augmenting images using the various transformations 
(rotations, cropping, shifting, zoom, grayscale, etc.), also need to have
images with different lightings/times of day, seasons, points of view, and
surrounding objects/obstacles.
