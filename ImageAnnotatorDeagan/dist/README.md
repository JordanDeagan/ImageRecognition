# ImageAnnotator
Command line based image annotation tool written in Python

#To Use
Before starting, have the images you want to annotate in a folder called "ToAnnotate". 
After that, open the Categories csv and enter the annotation categories. If there are more than 1 category to annotate the images with, start a new line in the csv and add the new set of categories there. The first line will always be treated as the primary category to annotate. 
Once the images are in the correct folder and the categories have been properly entered into Categories.csv, launch ImageAnnotation.exe and select the directory that the above created "ToAnnotate" folder is in. Once you run the program, the rest of the process is explained through the program.
